# This is a configuration sample.
# You should add your role ARNs and desired profiles.
# ===================================================

# This profile name must match the profile in ~/.aws/credentials file
# You should have something like this
#
# [main]
# aws_access_key_id = blabla
# aws_secret_access_key = blabla
main_profile = "main"

# MFA profile name. Default is '<main_profile>-mfa'.
# mfa_profile = "mfa"

# If it should be checked for new version.
check_new_version = true

# MFA serial number can be found in AWS web console -> IAM
mfa_serial_number = "arn:aws:iam::MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID:mfa/USERNAME"

# Uncomment and adjust the shell command if your MFA token can be provided by a script.
# Here is an example for yubikey.
# mfa_command = "ykman oath code | awk '/SOME_PATTERN/ {print $2}'"

[profiles]

# You can specify profiles by either providing the role ARNs
dev = "arn:aws:iam::123456589012:role/Admin"
prod = "arn:aws:iam::123456589013:role/TestRole"

# ... or by providing an object that can contain additional fields
[profiles.dev-read-only]

# This field is required
role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456589014:role/ReadOnly"

# (optional) Profile name that must be used to assume this role
# parent_profile = "dev"

# (optional)
# duration_sec = 7200

[profiles.dev-db]

# This field is required
role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456589014:role/Db"
